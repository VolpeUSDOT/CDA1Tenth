# Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) Educational Engineering Platform

## Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive educational engineering platform for students, educators, and researchers to delve into the exciting world of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). It offers a robust environment to develop, simulate, test, and analyze CAV technologies, fostering a deeper understanding of their design, operation, and impact.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Learning Modules:** Explore fundamental CAV concepts through interactive modules covering topics like vehicle dynamics, sensor technologies, communication protocols, path planning, and control algorithms. Visualizations and simulations enhance the learning experience.
* **Open-Source Development Kit (SDK):** Leverage the provided open-source SDK to create custom CAV applications, integrate with hardware platforms (if applicable), and explore advanced CAV functionalities.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   * Install Packages from requirements.txt
   * Create your own secrets.json file containing your mySQL/mariadb credentials (Temp until V2X integration)
2. **Installation:**
3. **Tutorials:**
   * Run UI from drayageUI.py in MapUI folder
   * Familiarize yourself with the platform's functionalities by working through the step-by-step tutorials in the `TUTORIALS` directory. These tutorials will guide you through basic tasks, simulations, and application development.
